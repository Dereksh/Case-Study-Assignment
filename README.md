## Overview and Origin

Fundrise - A new way to invest in Real Estate

Fundrise was founded in 2010 by Ben and Dan Miller in Washington D.C. as a way for anyone to invest in commercial real estate. Ben and Dan gained their passion and expertise in Real Estate from their father, Herb Miller, who operated Western Development corp. Herb and Western Development Corp. is responsible for developing 20 million square feet of real estate in the Washington, D.C. area. Ben and Dan both worked with their father at Western Development Corp, with Ben taking the role of President. Ben and Dan moved on to act as Managing Partners of WestMill Capital partners before moving on to start Fundrise. 

Originally, Fundrise was set up to raise capital for real estate companies. However, after the passing of the JOBS Act, Fundrise was able to expand to the platform to allow for direct investment to commercial real estate investments. 

The JOBS act, or Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012. The act allowed Fundrise to crowdfund and bring in capital from many non-institutional investors. More easily put, anyone could provide capital to Fundrise and in return be granted access to real estate securities. With this new law, Ben, Dan and Fundrise were able to acquire $15 Million in investments by 2014 from over 1000 investors. 

After the initial crowdfunding, Fundrise raised additional capital through a first-round series A stock offering of $38 million. The institutional money came from reputable companies and Venture Capitalists like Renren, Guggenheim Partners and Rockrose Development Corporation. 

Additional Funding came from the launch of an eReit, or an electronic Real Estate Investment Trust. The eReit allowed institutional and non-institutional investors access to real estate investments. The first eREIT raised $50 million, the second eReit raised an additional $50 million and finally an eFund launched in 2017 and raised an additional $50 million.


## Business Activities 

The Miller Brothers saw an opportunity to give access to thousands of retail investors that would like to gain exposure to commercial real estate but either do not have the know how or enough capital to do so. The only other option to gain exposure to real estate was through a Real estate investment trust, which is an actively managed investment product, typically with high fees and unnecessary middlemen. 

The intended customer, everyone. Any individual that does not have the capital to be considered an accredited investor or the licenses necessary to broker a real estate transaction will now have access to real estate investments for a fraction of the cost in a far more efficient model. According to calculations done by a company called NAREIT, using data from the CoStar All Properties database, as of 2018 Q4, the total approximate commercial property value is between $14.4 and $17 trillion. With Real Estate being one of the most proven assets classes of all time, the market is prime for investment opportunities. 

Fundrise now reports, as of 1/31/2020, that they have over 130 thousand investors with total transaction values of greater than $4.9 billion. They have reported Historical Annual Returns of 8.7-12.4%. 

The unfair advantage that Fundrise is using is cost. According to Ruth Lyons of Investing Junkie, a typical REIT charges upfront fees that can run anywhere from 20 to 30% of the value of the REIT. Vereit is a large commercial real estate investment trust headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. MarketWatch stock data currently reports that VER (stock Symbol) has a yield of 4.87% and an expense ratio of 0.60%. Compare this to Fundrise that reports between 8.7 and 12.4% total returns with total fees of 0.15% annually. The costs are lower, and the yields are higher. 

The second advantage is ease of set up. Fundrise states that an account can be created and set up within minutes. After creation of the account a portfolio strategy can be selected, and the deposited capital will be diversified across the funds tailored to that strategy. In comparison, to purchase a REIT that is listed on an exchange, a brokerage account must be set up. This requires multiple steps to be taken and sometimes can be slowed down as the brokerage must adhere to anti money laundering, patriot act and other requirements. Even after setting up the account, you will need to work with an advisor and pay fees to get a recommendation or an investor will need to research and invest themselves if using a self-directed service. Bottom line, Fundrise takes out the guess work and the extra leg work to get an investor allocated quickly to begin maximizing returns. 

Fundrise uses Amazon CloudFront for applications and data. Amazon CloudFront "is a web service that speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content such as .html, .css, .js and image files, to users." (AWS) This also data and user requests to be routed to a data server with the lowest latency possible. 

Fundrise also uses Mixpanel, which is a business analytics service company. Mixpanel tracks user interactions with web and mobile applications and provides tools for targeted communication with them. The Data that is collected is used to build custom reports and measure user engagement and retention. Fundrise allows uses Google Analytics, which is similar to Mixpanel in its tracking and reporting of website traffic and data. 

## Landscape

Fundrise is interesting because they fall into multiple domains. They offer Investment Management services as they will allocate capital into investment products. They are also considered Real Estate because they focus solely on real estate investment products. 

There have been major changes in this domain over the past 10 to 15 years. With the financial crash of 2008, real estate as a while was decimated. Bank regulation changes made it more difficult to obtain properties than it was prior to the crash, and there were far fewer brokers or banks that were wanting to get involved, or were liquid enough, to move back into the real estate space. With the JOBS act passing in 2012, it was no possible to crowdfund capital. This changed the entire landscape as anyone could through their money into the basket and now invest. This drastically increased the capital that Fundrise could use, without giving up majority ownership to a VC group or by paying huge fees and commission by issuing debt. The quick access in capital has helped Fundrise move from a startup company in 2012 to a company now with $1.1 billion in equity and debt deployed across $4.9 billion of real estate property. Less than a decade to a billion-dollar company, that does not happen very often. 

The three biggest names in the crowdfunding real estate space are Fundrise, Crowdstreet and Realty Mogul. The main difference between the three lies in the initial minimum investment amounts, the account fees and if they offer a private REIT or not. Fundrise has the lowest minimum investment amount at $500, the lowest account fees and they offer a private REIT. One major difference with Realty Mogul lies in the ability to invest in private real estate placements, which can be a riskier investment strategy and therefore, not as suitable for most investors. 

## Results 

The busines impact has been large but not huge currently. Major REIT still have far larger asset under management amounts, and I think there are still many investors that are afraid of real estate after possibly getting burned in 2008. However, the younger generation that is starting to accumulate wealth wants lower cost, technology driven investment opportunities and they likely were not directly affected by the real estate crash in 2008. Due to this, I think that this domain has a lot of room to grow in the future. 

As all investment companies do, performance is the core metric that is used to measure success. With Fundrise, we will compare total returns and annualized dividend yield with major competitors. 

Fundrise has seen cumulative total returns move from $0 in 2014 to nearly $130M in 2020. They have average annual returns ranging from a low of 8.76% in 2016 to a high of 12.42% in 2015 and the latest average annualized return of 9.47% in 2019. Fundrise has a current annualized dividend yield of 4.98% compared to 3.11% for Vanguards public real estate fund and 2.23% for Vanguards total public bond ETF.

## Recommendations

Fundrise offers extremely specific investment services in the real estate domain. I do not think it would be appropriate to branch out and offer additional investment products that are not within their niche expertise. I do think that they should offer some sort of tax advice as real estate can have many tax advantages that novice investors might not know about. The company could bring on CPAs or tax attorneys to help engineers build algorithms that can ideally place investors into tax advantaged products. For a slightly higher management fee, they could now offer investment services that provide favorable returns while also minimizing tax obligations. This service could be unbelievably valuable to investors.
