Fundrise - A new way to invest in Real Estate

Fundrise was founded in 2010 by Ben and Dan Miller in Washington D.C. as a way for anyone to invest in commercial real estate. Ben and Dan gained their passion and expertise in Real Estate from their father, Herb Miller, who operated Western Development corp. Herb and Western Development Corp. is responsibel for developing 20 million square feet of real estate in the Washinton, D.C. area. Ben and Dan both worked with their father at Western Development Corp, with Ben taking the role of President. Ben and Dan moved on to act as Managing Partners of WestMill Capital partners before moving on to start FundRise. 

Originally, FundRise was set up as a was to raise capital for real estate companies. However after the passing of the JOBS Act, FundRise was able to expand to the platform to allow for direct investment to commercial real estate investments. 

The JOBS act, or Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012. The act allowed FundRise to crowdfund and bring in capital from a large number of non institutional investors. More easily put, any one could provide capital to FundRise and in return be granted access to real estate securities. With this new law, Ben, Dan and FundRise were able to acquire $15 Million in investments by 2014 from over 1000 investors. 

After the inital crowdfunding, Fundrise raised additional capital through a first-round series A stock offering of $38 million. The institutional money came from reputable companies and Venture Capitalists like Renren, Guggenheim Partners and Rockrose Development Corporation. 

Addtional Funding came from the launch of an eReit, or an electronic Real Estate Investment Trust. The eReit allowed institutional and non institutional investors access to real estate investments. The first eREIT raised $50 million, the second eReit raised an addtional $50 million and finally an eFund launched in 2017 and raieed an additioanl $50 million.
